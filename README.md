<h2>Project Overview</h2>
"HealthStat" is an interactive data analytics dashboard developed to analyze and visualize healthcare data related to elective hip replacement inpatient surgeries across hospitals in New York State. Built using Microsoft Power BI, this project provides a comprehensive tool for healthcare professionals, administrators, and policymakers to gain actionable insights into hospital performance, patient outcomes, and cost efficiency. The dashboard leverages real-time data to support data-driven decision-making, with a focus on length of stay (LOS), cost per discharge, hospital comparisons, and patient demographics.

## Key Features

- **Home Page: Overview Metrics Snapshot**  
The Home Page provides a concise summary of key performance indicators, displaying metrics such as total surgeons (627), average Length of Stay (LOS) at 2.65 days, total hospitals (151), and total discharges (26K), enabling a quick overview of healthcare performance.

- **Home Page: Streamlined Navigation**  
Navigation on the Home Page is designed for ease of use, offering seamless access to detailed sections like LOS Comparison, Cost Comparison, and Hospital Profile through an intuitive navigation bar, enhancing user experience.

- **LOS Comparison Page: Hospital Performance Insights**  
The LOS Comparison Page visualizes the average Length of Stay (LOS) and total discharges for the top 15 hospitals, highlighting Kings County Hospital with the highest LOS (12.0 days) and Alice Hyde Medical Center with the lowest (1.7 days), aiding in performance benchmarking.

- **LOS Comparison Page: Key Influencer Analysis**  
This page identifies critical factors impacting LOS, such as severity of illness (adding 8.96 days) and health service area (e.g., New York City adding 1.66 days), using key influencer analysis to uncover actionable insights for healthcare optimization.

- **Cost Comparison Page: Cost and LOS Insights**  
The Cost Comparison Page features a scatter plot comparing average LOS and cost per discharge by hospital, with color-coded regions like Finger Lakes, Hudson, and Long Island, providing quick insights into cost efficiency and resource allocation.


<h2>Tech Stack </h2>
