<h2>Project Overview</h2>
"HealthStat" is an interactive data analytics dashboard developed to analyze and visualize healthcare data related to elective hip replacement inpatient surgeries across hospitals in New York State. Built using Microsoft Power BI, this project provides a comprehensive tool for healthcare professionals, administrators, and policymakers to gain actionable insights into hospital performance, patient outcomes, and cost efficiency. The dashboard leverages real-time data to support data-driven decision-making, with a focus on length of stay (LOS), cost per discharge, hospital comparisons, and patient demographics.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

- <b>Home Page: Overview Metrics
The Home Page offers a snapshot of key performance indicators, displaying metrics like total surgeons (627), average LOS (2.65 days), total hospitals (151), and total discharges (26K) for a quick overview.</b> 
- <b>Home Page: Navigation
Navigation on the Home Page is streamlined, providing easy access to detailed sections like LOS Comparison, Cost Comparison, and Hospital Profile through a clear navigation bar.</b>
- <b>LOS Comparison Page: Hospital Performance
The LOS Comparison Page visualizes the average LOS and total discharges for the top 15 hospitals, highlighting Kings County Hospital (12.0 days) as the highest and Alice Hyde Medical Center (1.7 days) as the lowest.</b>
- <b>LOS Comparison Page: Key Influencers
This page identifies factors affecting LOS, such as severity of illness (adding 8.96 days) and health service area (e.g., New York City adding 1.66 days), using key influencer analysis.</b>
- <b>Cost Comparison Page: Cost Insights
The Cost Comparison Page features a scatter plot comparing average LOS and cost per discharge by hospital, with color-coded regions like Finger Lakes, Hudson, and Long Island for quick insights.</b>


<h2>Tech Stack </h2>

- <b>Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation.</b>

- <b>Power Query (M Language) – Data transformation and cleaning.</b>

- <b>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculated fields.</b> 


<h2>Why This Project? </h2>

- <b>I developed HealthStat to address inefficiencies in elective hip replacement surgeries in New York State, where variations in LOS and costs impact patient care and hospital finances, aiming to provide a tool for identifying disparities and driving improvements.</b> (21H2)
